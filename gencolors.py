## From: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/470690/how-to-automatically-generate-n-distinct-colors
## (Heavily) adapted by HV to work with Python 2.6 and up
## Simplified to generate HSV (PGPLOT understands HSV as Hue-Saturation-Lightness)
## Also: I wanted the getfracs() to divide the colors nicer over the colourspace
##       so there's an assumption about how many variations of each colour are created
##       such that we can divide the "H" colour space in roughly even bits.
##       If you requested a low number of colours from the original code, they would be
##       rather close to each other
