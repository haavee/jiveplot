# Revision 1.8  2017-01-27 13:50:28  jive_cc
# HV: * jplotter.py: small edits
#         - "not refresh(e)" => "refresh(e); if not e.plots ..."
#         - "e.rawplots.XXX" i.s.o. "e.plots.XXX"
#     * relatively big overhaul: in order to force (old) pyrap to
#       re-read tables from disk all table objects must call ".close()"
#       when they're done.
#       Implemented by patching the pyrap.tables.table object on the fly
#       with '__enter__' and '__exit__' methods (see "ms2util.opentable(...)")
#       such that all table access can be done in a "with ..." block:
#          with ms2util.opentable(...) as tbl:
#             tbl.getcol('DATA') # ...
#       and then when the with-block is left, tbl gets automagically closed
#
# Revision 1.7  2015-09-23 12:28:36  jive_cc
# HV: * Lorant S. requested sensible requests (ones that were already in the
#       back of my mind too):
#         - option to specify the data column
#         - option to not reorder the spectral windows
#       Both options are now supported by the code and are triggered by
#       passing options to the "ms" command
#
# Revision 1.6  2014-04-08 22:41:11  jive_cc
# HV: Finally! This might be release 0.1!
#     * python based plot iteration now has tolerable speed
#       (need to test on 8M row MS though)
#     * added quite a few plot types, simplified plotters
#       (plotiterators need a round of moving common functionality
#        into base class)
#     * added generic X/Y plotter
#
# Revision 1.5  2013-08-20 18:23:50  jive_cc
# HV: * Another savegame
#       Got plotting to work! We have stuff on Screen (tm)!
#       Including the fance standardplot labels.
#       Only three plot types supported yet but the bulk of the work should
#       have been done I think. Then again, there's still a ton of work
#       to do. But good progress!
#
# Revision 1.4  2013-06-19 12:28:44  jive_cc
# HV: * making another savegame
#
# Revision 1.3  2013-02-19 16:53:29  jive_cc
# HV: * About time to commit - make sure all edits are safeguarded.
#       Making good progress. baselineselection, sourceselection and
#       timeselection working
#
# Revision 1.2  2013-01-29 12:23:45  jive_cc
# HV: * time to commit - added some more basic stuff
