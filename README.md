# jplotter / jiveplot
Python based visualization tool for AIPS++/CASA MeasurementSet data

The jplotter command line tool allows the user to quickly visualize the
radio-astronomical data contained in a MeasurementSet (`ms`).

## Python support

Starting from 20 Jul 2023 the `master` branch has been updated to support
Py2 and Py3 based systems simultaneously. This version is tagged [v2.0](https://github.com/haavee/jiveplot/releases/tag/v2.0). The
previous latest Py2-only master was tagged as
[v1.1](https://github.com/haavee/jiveplot/releases/tag/v1.1) and
[last-python2-only-master](https://github.com/haavee/jiveplot/releases/tag/last-python2-only-master).

Since Aug 2025 the module can be installed using `pip` - the project was restructured to adhere to modern Python packaging.
After cloning the repository it is possible to do
```bash
$ cd /path/to/clone
$ pip install [-e] .
```
Starting from *v2.1.0* the package is now also published on PyPI.


## 5 second workflow

After downloading and having the
[dependencies](https://github.com/haavee/jiveplot#dependencies) installed
(as of 30 Oct 2018 you can run from a [singularity or Docker](https://github.com/haavee/jiveplot#singularity-and-docker-container-images) image) type:

```bash
$ /path/to/jiveplot/jplotter
+++++++++++++++++++++ Welcome to cli +++++++++++++++++++
$Id: command.py,v 1.16 2015-11-04 13:30:10 jive_cc Exp $
  'exit' exits, 'list' lists, 'help' helps
jcli>
```
and you're in the command line environment. Then open a MS, select data,
select what to plot and go.

This README will not explain any further because there is a colourful [PDF cookbook/tutorial/explanation](jplotter-cookbook-draft-v2.pdf) with far more detail.

## What can be visualized?

Quantities that can be visualized are, e.g., amplitude-versus-time,
phase-versus-frequency, amplitude-versus-uv-distance, weight-versus-time, to
name but a few.

Some key features:
- the package focuses on powerful selection syntax
- has built-in help for all commands
- the ability to difference whole sets of plots, e.g. to visualize before-after changes or to
compare output of different correlators
- time- or frequency averaging of the data before plotting
- plots can be saved to file (postscript).
- plots/data sets can be organized at will
- the data can be indexed (`> indexr`) to create a scan list, after which powerful
  scan-based selection can be used
- plotting can be scripted/play back stored commands from text file
- open/visualize multiple data sets at the same time or the same data set
  from different 'angles'
- the current selection can be written out as a new *reference* `ms`; data is not copied but the newly created `ms` references rows of data in the parent `ms`. It can be treated as a real `ms`.

## Data selection
`ms`'s can contain several GBs of binary data. Therefore, data selection is
desirable, preferably in a fairly natural way, even without knowing the
exact details of the experiment's data.

The jplotter selection commands take a stab at suiting the needs of a radio
astronomer:

```sh
# select a time range near the end of the experiment
jcli> time $end-1h to +2m20s

# select IF 0,1,2 with parallel hand polarizations
jcli> fq  0-2/p
# equivalent, but would not work for XX, YY whereas the former would
jcli> fq  0-2/rr,ll

# select sources whose name matches this
jcli> src j(19|30)*

# select all cross baselines, remove those to stations xx and yy, but add xx-ef
jcli> bl cross -(xx|yy)* +xx(ef)

# select 80% of the band, irrespective of how many channels
# the correlator produced
jcli> ch 0.1*last:0.9*last

# after running indexr, extract a bit of data (trimming 1 minute from either
# end) from scans on sources matching 042* and who are longer than three minutes
jcli> scan start+1m to end-1m where length>3m and field ~ '042*'
```

# Dependencies

The package uses the [pyrap, python casacore](https://github.com/casacore/python-casacore)
Python binding to access data.

It uses pgplot to visualize (it was faster and easier than matplotlib):
[Python binding to pgplot](https://github.com/haavee/ppgplot) (the github version is preferred over this old  link: http://www.jive.eu/~verkout/ppgplot-1.4.tar.gz)

The github version became online during the course of 2018 and has a `setup.py` which has support for Python2 and 3, where the `ppgplot-1.4.tar.gz` lacks this.

Note: if the original `PGPLOT` is giving too many headaches, the [Giza](https://github.com/danieljprice/giza) library can be used as drop-in replacement for `ppgplot` to link against for its `libpgplot.so`. My [ppgplot fork](https://github.com/haavee/ppgplot)'s `setup.py` has support for having both FORTRAN PGPLOT and Giza installed and allows for compile-time selection of which *actual* pgplot backend to use.


# Singularity and Docker container images

As of 30 October 2018 [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images are available. In fact, the Singularity image just runs the Docker image. The [jiveplot Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/haavee/jiveplot/) contains `jiveplot` and all its dependencies and is built on top of the excellent [kernsuite/kern-4](http://kernsuite.info) project.

Even though all functionality is in the Docker image, we advise to run/install Singularity (if you have a choice) for the following reasons:

- X11 forwarding works out of the box with Singularity, which is convenient if you wish to actually *see* the plots on your screen. According to the interwebs X forwarding can be done through Docker as well but it didn't for me (see below)

- Your `${HOME}` directory is visible by default inside the Singularity container. This has the nice effect that your `jiveplot` command history and aliases are persisted between runs of the image (`~/.jcli.history` for the history). This in turn means that `^r` (reverse-search-history) is actually useful

- I'm not even going to mention the security issues of Docker which has to run as root

### Running the Singularity image

*UPDATE* November 2019 - because of [Singularity security
changes](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularityhub-docs/2019/security-release/#api-access)
it is now recommended to use the following method of running the jiveplot
container:

```bash
$ singularity pull shub://haavee/jiveplot:latest
# this will give you a local `path/to/*.simg` file
$ singularity run --bind <local dir>:<container dir> path/to/*.simg
```

where `<local dir>` is the/a directory on your host where your CASA
MeasurementSet(s) live and `<container dir>` is the desired mount point
_inside_ the container.

### Running the Docker image

Allegedly, running Docker like this:
```bash
$ docker run -it --init --network=host -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro -e DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" -v <local dir>:<container dir> haavee/jiveplot
```
does X11 forwarding but yours truly has seen it also *not* work. YMMV.

Both commands should drop you immediately into the `jiveplot` command line interface:

```bash
+++++++++++++++++++++ Welcome to cli +++++++++++++++++++
$Id: command.py,v 1.16 2015-11-04 13:30:10 jive_cc Exp $
  'exit' exits, 'list' lists, 'help' helps
jcli> ms <container dir>/path/to/my_data.ms
MS my_data.ms opened &cet
jcli> 
```
